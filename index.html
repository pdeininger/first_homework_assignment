        Welcome to my page! I'm brand new to coding but really excited to be
        learning. I've used a program called Articulate Storyline that is for
        building online learning and enjoyed it very much. However, I didn't
        realize how it was related to coding until looking at some coding how-to
        sites. While Articulate Storyline isn't coding exactly, it requires a
        similar thought process and that is what sold me.

        Most of what I know about computers, I've learned pretty much through
        work. I took a couple of classes while pursuing my undergrad (UR SCPS
        Class of 2006! GO SPIDERS!) but those were very basic. In one class, we
        were required to build a website and present it to the class. My site
        was about the artist Frida Kahlo. She did great work, but not until I
        was presenting to the class did it occur to me how tragic her life was.
        Anyhoo, check out her art.<a
