                      <p>Welcome to my page!  I'm brand new to coding but really excited to be learning.  I've used a program called Articulate Storyline that is for building online learning and enjoyed it very much.  However, I didn't realize how it was related to coding until looking at some coding how-to sites.  While Articulate Storyline isn't coding exactly, it requires a similar thought process and that is what sold me.</p>
